# Travelling-Salesman-Problem
Normally, a travelling salesman has to visit a series of cities for the orders. The problem that arises is that -how is he supposed to choose the shortest path between the    cities with the given constraints that he should not repeat the cities even once. If he repeats the cities or chooses the path which may be longer than the others, his cost of travelling as well as the time consumed will increase simultaneously, which will make his work delay. Hence, the need of the hour is to find the least or the minimum path he can travel while traversing through a list of cities, without repeating them.
 
So, I have implemented Primâ€™s algorithm in order solve the problem, which is one of the possible algorithms to solve such kind of problems.
